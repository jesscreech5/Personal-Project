# Personal-Project

Objective: The goal of this project is to have the user enter a ticker for a stock with a large variety of information returned to them. This information includes descriptive statistics, volatility analysis, volume analysis, and more. The goal is to provide an easy way to understand detailed information about the stock of interest.

Background: I chose this idea because it follows a lot of my key interests in data analysis while challenging me with financial data. This project aims to enhance my ability to analyze financial markets and allows any user to better understand market dynamics. This project provides a foundation for more advanced studies or professional activities in financial fields.

Features and Functionality: 
•	User Interface: For this project I will be using Tkinter as the UI due to its simplicity.
•	Exploratory Data: 
o	Upon the user’s request (either through typing the topic of interest or through a selection tool), the code will produce a variety of descriptive statistics for any column of interest (mean, median, standard deviation, minimum, maximum).
o	The user will also be able to request a plot of the closing prices over time to visualize the performance. 
•	Volatility Analysis:
o	Calculating the daily percentage change in closing prices 
o	Plotting a histogram of daily percentage changes
o	Determining specific days with the highest volatility. 
•	Volume Analysis: 
o	Analyzing the relationship between trading volume and daily percentage change and checking for correlation
o	Plotting trading volume over time to highlight days with exceptionally high or low volume.
